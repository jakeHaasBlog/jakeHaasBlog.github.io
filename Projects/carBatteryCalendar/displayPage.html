			This is the project that I personally am the most proud of. This project went beyond simply making a program because I thought it would be cool. There was purpose and intent behind making this and it was meant to serve a real purpose and help people. When I heard about the problems that the new glass-matte batteries were causing at my dad's work all I could think about was that I am capable of using my programming skills to help create a solution. At the time I didn't have the same level of familiarity with Java swing as I have now and the first prototype of the program <i>worked</i>, but it was UGLY. I presented it to the CEO of the dealership and we went over the program and discussed the feasability of improving it in a way that would make it function better. One major point he wanted to be added was the ability to search a car's charging history. I took a few days to improve it and came back with a redesigned program that met every requirement. He seemed very pleased with it and i'm thankful for the experience of working with him to develop this simple piece of software.
