			This project behaves simularly to a game called Terraria, and is an idea that I have been thinking about making for a long time. The basic idea is that you must mine and gather resources that can be transformed into different kinds of matter. These pieces of matter can be used to build defensive structures to resist the zombie appocolipse.
