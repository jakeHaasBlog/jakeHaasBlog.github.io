I made this tic-tac-toe program using a Java swing JFrame and an overwritten paint component method.

the game features a two player mode and a single player mode in which a simple set of logistic rules will attempt to win a game against you.

in two player mode the first piece placement is always an X and the piece alternates every placement.

when a player wins the score is shown and will be stored for the remainder of the session.

clicking the reset button will reset the board, but will not reset the score

when the board is full with no winners a draw is called and neither player recieves added score.

The "AI" has three difficulty settings, easy, medium and hard. The easy A.I places pieces at random.

the medium difficulty A.I has a 70% chance of playing the perfect move every turn

the hard A.I plays the determined best move every turn and should not be possible to win against.s
