		<div class="textSpace">
			This project was made to test the efficiency of a variety of sorting algorithms including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quiksort. The text files in the src folder can be replaced with new numbers as long as the file name remains either 10nums.txt or 10000nums.txt, though each file can have as many numbers as you want.
