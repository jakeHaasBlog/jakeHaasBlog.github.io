					This is the first project that I decided to take on with javascript. I thought it would be a good place to start because it incorperated many fundimental programming consepts such as arrays, object oriented programming, keyboard input, loops, and javascript text-nodes, and allowed me to become more familliar with the strange syntax of javascript.<br><br>
					One majour challenge I faced with this project was figuring out text nodes. Before I took on this challenge I had no idea what a text node in javascript was, and when I started the project I threw together the data structures neccisary to hold the rgb values and the ASCII values of every character in a multi-dimentional array without knowing how to display them. On top of that I had programmed the arrays incorrectly, when I initialized the arrays to hold an ASCIIchar instance(from a class I made called ASCIIchar) I had initialized them as myarray[x][y] = new ASCIIchar(); when it was really supposed to be myarray[x][y] = new ASCIIchar;. I used a text editor called <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a>(highly recomend btw) and did not know how to get error messages, so when I ran my program and nothing happened I unknowingly had two errors. Eventually I realized how to initialize my arrays properly and that my display function was not working correctly. This befundled me for a while because when I was using Java swing previously there were elements called JLables that supported html that would have worked with the code I was using. The real issue ended up being that I was using a textArea which does not support innerHtml and used a "div" instaid. In the tutorial for this project I cover how I should have done it in the first place.
