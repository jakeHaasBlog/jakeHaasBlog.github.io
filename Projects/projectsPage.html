					This is the first project that I decided to take on with javascript. I thought it would be a good place to start because it incorperated many fundimental programming consepts such as arrays, object oriented programming, keyboard input, loops, and javascript text-nodes, and allowed me to become more familliar with the strange syntax of javascript.<br><br>
					One majour challenge I faced with this project was figuring out text nodes. Before I took on this challenge I had no idea what a text node in javascript was, and when I started the project I threw together the data structures neccisary to hold the rgb values and the ASCII values of every character in a multi-dimentional array without knowing how to display them. On top of that I had programmed the arrays incorrectly, when I initialized the arrays to hold an ASCIIchar instance(from a class I made called ASCIIchar) I had initialized them as myarray[x][y] = new ASCIIchar(); when it was really supposed to be myarray[x][y] = new ASCIIchar;. I used a text editor called <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a>(highly recomend btw) and did not know how to get error messages, so when I ran my program and nothing happened I unknowingly had two errors. Eventually I realized how to initialize my arrays properly and that my display function was not working correctly. This befundled me for a while because when I was using Java swing previously there were elements called JLables that supported html that would have worked with the code I was using. The real issue ended up being that I was using a textArea which does not support innerHtml and used a "div" instaid. In the tutorial for this project I cover how I should have done it in the first place.

					This program is a perlin noide flow field. Perlin noise first came to my attention about a year ago when I was watching youtube and got a recomendation for a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">theCodingTrain</a> called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf4dIN99e2w">"13.1: Introduction - Perlin Noise and p5.js Tutorial"</a>. At the time I thought it was really cool but it was to complicated for me to ever figure out and didn't think much of it. For whatever reason a year later when I began learning javascript I decided to go back to this video and try to reproduce the results, since then I have created three perlin noise flow fields, one in javascript, one in C++, and one in Java using processing(basicly p5.js in Java). Somthing about flow fields is just straight up cool, and making them more accesable to people is what this project is all about. This program allows you to adjust values and come up with cool results even without creating a whole new program to do it. I have portfolio I guess i'll call it <a href="perlinNoise/portfolio/perlinNoisePortfolio.html">here</a> where I show some of the results I got while playing around with the actual code so some of them can't be produced with this project. The pictures are all open source so if you want to download them as wallpapers thats ok with me ; )
