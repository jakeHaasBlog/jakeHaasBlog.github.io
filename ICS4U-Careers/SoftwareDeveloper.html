		<h3 class='subtitle'>Overview - What do software developers do?</h3>

		<div id='descriptionBoard'>
			Software developers are the people you probably think of when you hear computer scientist, or programmer. They are the one's responsible for writing the applications that you use every day, like netbeans, photoshop, and microsoft word. Being a software developer involves overseeing, and being a part of the entire deveopment lifecycle of a piece of software. Software developer is an umbrella term that applies to many different job titles and skill sets, they are often in charge of planning and distibuting tasks to lower tier developers and programmers, and play a key role in development. Software developers often work in teams with other developers and lay the foundation for programmers to build upon, they are also often responsible for QA, or quality assurance, and run diagnostc tests on the software in development throughout it's lifecycle.

			<h2 class='subtitle'>Education Requirements</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					In order to get a job in software development a bachelors degree in computer science or software engineering is usually required.
				</li>
				<li>
					Often times a strong understanding of math is required, this includes a series of calculus courses, differential equations, and linear algebra. A sequence of physics is also required which is usually covered in the first two years of a computer science program.
				</li>
				<li>
					In order to get  a job as a software developer it is a requirement to have a strong understanding of the specific programming languages that apply to the job you are looking for: 
					<ul>
						<li>C++, C, and Java are most commonly used for desktop applications</li>
						<br>
						<li>Java is used in communications, education, finance, health sciences, hospitality, retail and utilities applications.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Ruby can be used independently for  professional services, design, science and quality control, or it can be used as a part of the ruby on rails web framework for web application development.</li>
						<br>
						<li>HTML, and CSS are used collectively to create and style webpages</li>
						<br>
						<li>Javascript is used for backend web development, and client-side operations, meaning it runs on a client computer rather than a server. It is also used for web game development, and specific pieces of front end development.</li>
						<br>
						<li>C# is used in unity for developing videogames, and is the go-to language for writing microsoft apps for windows.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Objective C is used primarily to develop applications for IOS and Mac OS</li>
						<br>
						<li>PHP is a general use programming language used to create dynamic web page content, and manage data in servers.</li>
					<ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>In addition to knowing specific programming languages it is important for software developers to have a solid understanding of algorithms to process data efficiently, and knowledge in frameworks, and external resources specific to the requirements of the job.</li>

			</ul>

			<h3 class='subtitle'>Essential skills and work habits</h3>

			<div>
				Some of the essential skills that are required by software developers are the ability to interperet and write in computer language, and the ability to understand and create efficiant algoriths to solve a variety of problems. Social skills are another very important skill that is required for software developers to have, at the end of the day a software developer's job is to produce software that will fill the wants and needs of a client. Without the ability to communicate effectively throughout the entire development process it is impossible to effectivly produce an piece of software that will fill the requirements of the client.
				<br><br>
				One essential work habit for software developers is to write clean, reusable code. When writing code to develop software there are many things that are shared between almost all programs, and your old code can simply be copy pasted in. An example of this is my GUIHelper class that I use for my computer science course, in almost all of my programs for this course I am required to build a simple GUI using java swing components. Normally this takes a lot of repetitive and monotonous code, but because I created a class to do it for me in my first program that I wrote for the course I can simply copy and paste the class into my current projects to save me time and effort constantly rewriting it.

			<h3 class='subtitle'>Future Outlook and Salary</h3>

			<div>
				The future outlook of this career path is very promissing, according to the bureao of labour statistics the projected growth of the job market for software developers between 2016 and 2026 was 24%, much higer than most other occupations. One thing to note however is that software developer is an umbrella term meaning anydody who develops software for a living, and it is important to look at what you want to do specifically for a better idea of the projected growth in that area.
				<br><br>
				According to the indeed.com the average annual income of software developers in Canada in 2017 was between $52,649 and $94,557 from 2015-2018.

			<h3 class='subtitle'>Post-Secondary Education Opportunities</h3>

			<div>
				Due to the fact that a bachelors degree is usually required to get a job in software development it is highly recomended that you attend a university program for your post-secondary education. College programs do exist that teach programming, but being a software developer means more than just programming, and computer science is usually the degree you want to have in order to learn skills that will allow you to solve real world problems such as algorithms and data structures. 
				<br><br>
				For people who don't have the means to attend a university there is another option, bootcamps. Although a certificate from a bootcamp is not as valuable in the job market as a formal degree, they still hold some weight and can lead you to your first job. A coding bootcamp is an intensive program teaching specific toolsets pertaining to software development, the average length of a coding bootcamp is 6-28 weeks and uppon completion you will usually recieve a certificate proving your knowlege in that area of study, and a portfolio containing projects completed durring the course. The prerequisites nessisary to gain attmitance into a coding bootcamp can range from no programming experience to a lot of programming experience depending on the specific curriculum in that bootcamp, having taken prior highschool or college courses is usually not important in applying. The average cost of a Canadian coding bootcamp is between $7995 - $14500 according to <a href='https://www.coursereport.com/blog/canadian-bootcamp-landscape'>Course Report.com</a>. Note however that these courses are very fast pased and a 4 month course will not be as well rounded as a 4 year degree at a university, they focus on quickly teaching neccesary and practical tools used in the industry.
				<br><br>

			<h3 class='subtitle'>Personal Reflection</h3>

			<div>
				For me personally, this is a career that I would like to pursue. The skills and abilities that I currently posess are closely related to a career in software development. I currently have some knowlege of the C programming language, and a more solid knowlege of the languages C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and HTML(if you consider that a programming language), and have taken two semesters of computer science in high school, I have also selected all of the recommended and pre-requisite courses for a computer science degree program at the University of Windsor. In order to prepare myself for a graduate program at the University of Windsor I need to focus on completing my advanced functions course, vectors and calculus, and getting better grades in english. Out of the skills listed in the Ontario Skills Passport the skills I need improvment in are reading and writing. English has always been my weakest subject, and both reading and writing are a value of 4 out of 5 in the passport. Some of the steps I would take to prepare for a career in software development are learning more about algorithms and specific frameworks and tools that are important in the areas that i'm interested in. Another step I would take is improving my social skills, I am a shy and introverted person but communication is one of the most valuable skills you can have in software development to coordinate with your team of developers, and your client.
