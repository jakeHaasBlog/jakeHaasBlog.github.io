					Okay, so if you read the discription of this tutorial you already know the basic outline of this portion of the ASCII game tutorial. When it comes to learning new programming languages I find it helpfull to start with trying to make an ASCII game, this is due to a couple of reasons; firstly, it combines a lot of the more simple programming concepts in a very step-by-step way that tests your knowlege one piece at a time. And secondly, it does not require any advanced knowlege of computer graphics. <br><br>
					We are going to start with making a class to hold all the data necessary for a tile in our game. This will include r, g, b, color and charactor, x, y position will be determined by the corrosponding position in the map array.<br><br>
					<div class="code">
						<pre>
class ASCIIchar {
	constructor(){
		this.r = 0;
		this.g = 0;
		this.b = 0;
		this.c = 'x';
	}
}
						</pre>
					</div>
					<br>
					The next step is making a map class which will hold a multidimentional array of ASCIIchar elements. This will make managing data later on much easier, and we will eventually be adding methods to edit the map more effectively.

					<div class="code">
						<pre>
var WIDTH = 30;
var HEIGHT = 30;

class ASCIImap {
	constructor(){
		this.asciiArray = new Array(WIDTH)
		for (var x = 0; x < WIDTH; x++){
			this.asciiArray[x] = new Array(HEIGHT);
		}
		for (var x = 0; x < WIDTH; x++){
			for (var y = 0; y < HEIGHT; y++){
				this.asciiArray[x][y] = new ASCIIchar;
			}
		}
	}
}
						</pre>
					</div>

					Thats all there is to creating the map. All we have to do now is make an instance of it
